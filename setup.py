"""
Build hook for the `risearch-tauso` Python package.

The C source for RIsearch1 lives in `RIsearch1/src/` and is compiled by CMake to
`RIsearch1/bin/RIsearch`. This script wraps that build into a normal setuptools
step: at wheel-build time it runs cmake, then copies the binary into the package
as `risearch_tauso/bin/RIsearch` so it ships as package data.

All static metadata is in `pyproject.toml`.
